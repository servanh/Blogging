                       <p>Navigating the Mexican and American world simultaneously is what many of us Chicanas do each day. Growing up in south Texas and crossing the border each weekend into Mexico to visit my Abuelos and help with my Dad’s arcade business provided me with lots of

                        adventures and also some frustrations as I didn’t feel I was from Mexico or from the U.S.  I was in a sort of Spanglish limbo. At times I

                        felt like I missed out on a little bit of both worlds. Throughout school, on the last day each year, I would say goodbye to my friends and

                        head to Mexico where I would stay until school started back up again. So that meant not hanging out with friends during the summer break

                        but instead hanging out with my primos and primas in Nuevo Leon, Mexico. Then it was time for me to go back home and I would always

                        wonder what it would be like to keep on living in Mexico with all the new friends I made during the summer. When I would return each

                        August it was back to square one on making new friends in the U.S. It was worth it as those summer days in Mexico were filled with daily

                        regañadas from my Abuelita, running after the elote man, and throwing rocks at the neighbors across the street during our wars that

                        we had in the neighborhood with a band of very mean brothers. My relatives and other Mexicans welcomed me with tamales and tortillas

                        de harina however they also treated me as though I wasn’t on of them.  Not knowing all the latest slang didn’t help my cause and

                        words like “chido” and “a toda maquina” were caught on late by me and they were met with pure laughter from my relatives who were like

                        “um those are naca words now.”  Things got a little more difficult when I moved to a small town in Oklahoma.  Simple things like talking

                        to my mom in Spanish at the grocery store drew the attention of all the curious town folk.  The kids at school were a little cruel at times

                        and said things like “go back to Mexico.”  I didn’t know where I belonged. As I grew up and the awkward teenage stages where you

                       don’t know who you are were behind me, I found out who I was. This woman I found was not Mexican and not American.  She is Chicana

                        and proud of being the best of both worlds and a perfect blend of both like the chile and mayo in a delicious elote.  I speak Spanglish with

                        the best of them and feel like a part of something great. I’m now a 30 something Chicana mom with a one-year-old child who I

                        now have the responsibility of passing on our Latino culture, foods, language, and just straight up badassness that comes with being Latino.

                        Throughout my blog I will show you a little bit about our world and how we are navigating it through travel, food, fashion, and some

                        funny stories in between.  Espero que lo disfruten my fellow Mamis!</>
